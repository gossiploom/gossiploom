# Vite React Project with shadcn/ui and TypeScript

This is a web application built with Vite, React, shadcn/ui, and TypeScript.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can install them from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>
    ```

    ```
3.  Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
