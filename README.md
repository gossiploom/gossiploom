GossipLoom – Community Gossip & Entertainment News Platform

GossipLoom is a community-driven gossip and entertainment news website built with WordPress. It allows anyone to publish content directly from the frontend without needing to create an account. Users can post anonymously or with their chosen name, and others can contribute to or expand on existing posts. The site is designed with simplicity, and openness.

✨ Features

Frontend Posting:
Users can submit gossip articles, trending stories, or entertainment news without logging in.

Anonymous or Named Posting:
Contributors may remain anonymous or display a chosen name alongside their post.

Collaborative Contributions:
Others can add to or update existing posts to keep stories fresh and engaging.

Content Moderation:
Automated keyword filters and basic manual moderation keep the platform in line with community standards.

No User Accounts or Backend Profiles:
No personal data is stored—only the submitted content is published.

SEO & AdSense Ready:
All content is unique, structured, and optimized.
